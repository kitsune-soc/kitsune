description: Configure the OpenTelemetry support of Kitsune

Kitsune can export its traces via the OpenTelemetry Protocol (or OTLP, for short).

To push the data to an endpoint, add the following to your configuration:

```toml
[opentelemetry]
# Where Kitsune pushes traces (eg. Jaeger)
tracing-transport = "http" # "http" or "grpc"
tracing-endpoint = "https://localhost:5050/tracing-endpoint"
```
