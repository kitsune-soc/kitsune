## Meet Hangaku

The kitsune chilling at the top of the page, that's Hangaku! She's the mascot of Kitsune.

She's a netrunner who grew up in in Kabuki, Night City.
From a young age she hacked major corps and made a name for herself, only rivaled by the likes of the legendary Rache Bartmoss.

But even with her that kind of status, she rarely teams up with anyone.
The exception to that is her cousin, [John Cyberdon](https://garden.pionaiki.com/posts/tihyltew/cyberdon).
(Don't ask me about the logistics here. A Mastodon related to a Kitsune? It's a long story.)

> John Cyberdon is the official mascot of the [CORTEX IMPLANT Mastodon instance](https://corteximplant.com).
> And yes, I have the permission to canonically make them cousins.

The 'claws often tried to get her to join, but she always managed to get out of their "invitations" (often even through, let's call them "drastic" measures).
