Kitsune has a number of configurations that change how your instance works.

```toml
[instance]
allow-non-ascii-usernames = false
name = "Kitsune"
description = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lnnPnr_0SU"
character-limit = 5000
registrations-open = true
```

## `allow-non-ascii-usernames`

Kitsune's database schema allows us to store usernames in a way that:

1. Ignores the case
2. Ignores the accent markers, etc.

That way we can store usernames in the database that aren't strictly ASCII letters, meaning you could sign up using the username `äumeträ`.  
And it would also automatically reserve any mutations of your username.

For example, getting the username `äumeträ` would automatically reserve these usernames, too:

- `AUMETRA`
- `Äumetra`
- `áumetrà`

and so on..

<Aside>
  This doesn't allow you to sign up with emoji, such as 🎈. It will still
  require your name to be alphanumeric, just in any alphabet that unicode
  supports!
</Aside>

This is opt-in, since we aren't quite sure yet how other fediverse software, such as Mastodon, handles non-ASCII usernames.

## `name`

This changes the name of the instance displayed on the landing page and returned via instance metadata endpoints (such as Mastodon's `/api/v1/instance`).

## `description`

<Aside type="tip">This field is interpreted as raw HTML</Aside>

Similar to `name`, this setting adjusts the description on the landing page and the one returned via the metadata endpoints.

## `character-limit`

This setting sets the character limit specific to your instance.

## `statistics-mode`

Control how statistics about your server are reported.

Possible values:

- `regular`: Return accurate statistics read from the database
- `zero`: Set all the statistics to zero
- `random`: Set all the statistics to random values

The settings `zero` and `random` are great if you don't want crawlers to figure out how many people are on your instance.  

<Aside type="caution">Booting your instance into `random` mode might upset techbros</Aside>

## `registrations-open`

Determines whether your instance accepts new users or not. When set to `false`, the registration APIs will return a failure code.

## `webfinger-domain`

This enables you to host your `.well-known/webfinger` resource on your main domain (i.e. `example.com`) and the web UI and inboxes on a subdomain (i.e. `kitsune.example.com`).  
The advantage of this configuration is that your handle can be `@me@example.com`, while the account is hosted on `fedi.example.com`.

### Example value

```toml
webfinger-domain = "example.com"
```
