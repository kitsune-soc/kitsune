description: Configure the full-text search of Kitsune
---

Kitsune has a number of search backends, each different from the other, to best fit your specific needs.
We want to give you a brief overview over the available backends.

## No Search

```toml
[search]
type = "none"
```

This completely disables the search on your instance. Finding posts and accounts is now only possible via direct links and handles.

## SQL-based Search

```toml
[search]
type = "sql"
```

This runs searches on your database directly. The quality is actually not too bad and uses automatic language detection to make full-text searches relevant.
