# Introduction

Kitsune is a decentralised microblogging platform built on the ActivityPub protocol.  
This means that anyone can run their own Kitsune on their own hardware and seamlessly interact with each other.

Of course you can also sign up on an existing instance to try it out, no strings attached.  
If you are interested in running your own instance, head over to our installation guide.
