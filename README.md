Kitsune is an open-source social media server utilising the ActivityPub protocol.
Utilising the capabilities of ActivityPub, you can interact with people on Mastodon, Misskey, Akkoma, etc.
Due to its decentralised nature, you can self-host Kitsune on your own hardware and still interact with everyone!

Kitsune itself is pretty lightweight and should run even on a Raspberry Pi (even though we haven't tested that yet).
