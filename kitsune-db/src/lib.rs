//!
//! Database crate for Kitsune
//!
//! Contains all the database entities and boilerplate to define all the relationships
//!
//! **Important**: If you ever regenerate the database entities, make sure to fix all the fields that contain enum values.
//! These fields are defined as integers in the database and the CLI will generate them as such.
//!
//! Also, please generate the entities from a Postgres database. Postgres will generate the most accurate entities.
//!
